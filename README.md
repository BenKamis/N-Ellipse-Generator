Pretty self-explanitory project I made for fun:

Set a number of foci and the program will put that number of foci randomly around a grid and find the n-ellipse centered around those foci.
N = 1 generates a circle
N = 2 generates a common oval
N = 3+ generates more complicated n-ellipses

I was just curious what the resulting shapes would look like so I made this program to find out.
